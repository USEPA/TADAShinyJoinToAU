# Test your app

## Run checks ----
## Check the package before sending to prod
devtools::check()
# rhub::check_for_cran()

# Deploy

## Local, CRAN or Package Manager ----
## This will build a tar.gz that can be installed locally,
## sent to CRAN, or to a package manager
# devtools::build()

## Docker ----
# ## If you want to deploy via a generic Dockerfile
# golem::add_dockerfile_with_renv()
# ## If you want to deploy to ShinyProxy
# golem::add_dockerfile_with_renv_shinyproxy()

## Posit ----
## If you want to deploy on Posit related platforms
golem::add_positconnect_file()
golem::add_shinyappsio_file()
golem::add_shinyserver_file()

## Deploy to Posit Connect or ShinyApps.io ----

## Add/update manifest file (optional; for Git backed deployment on Posit )
rsconnect::writeManifest()
